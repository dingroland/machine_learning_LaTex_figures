# Machine Learning Figures

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of figures created using LaTeX and TikZ to visually represent various machine learning concepts. These illustrations are designed to aid understanding and cover topics such as:

## Topics Covered
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN):** Intuitive visualizations of kNN classification and hyperparameter effects.
- **kD-Trees:** Illustrations of spatial partitioning for efficient kNN searches.
- **Regression and Classification:** Examples of regression lines, decision boundaries, and evaluation metrics.
- **Train-Test Split:** Explanation of data splitting for model validation.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Formula and visual examples with intuitive scenarios.
- **Accuracy and Confusion Matrices:** Detailed breakdown with True Positives, False Positives, and metrics like TPR/TNR.
- **Hyperparameters:** Clear examples of stride, learning rates, and batch sizes.
- **Missing Data Handling:** Techniques like exclusion, mean imputation, and KNN-based imputation.
- **Normalization and Transformation:** Before-and-after transformations with distribution visualizations.
- **One-Hot Encoding:** Encoding categorical variables for ML models.
- **Outliers and Class Imbalance:** Boxplots, statistical comparisons, and resampling techniques.
- **Feature Selection and PCA:** Dimensionality reduction, Eigenfaces, and variance-capturing principal components.
- **Overfitting and Underfitting:** Indicators and examples in regression and decision trees.
- **Clustering (k-Means, Hierarchical):** Visual examples, including dendrograms and the elbow method.

## PDF Progress
A compiled PDF (`figures_ml_progress.pdf`) is included to showcase the current progress of all figures in the repository. This file will be regularly updated as new illustrations are added.

## How to Use
The figures are embedded in a LaTeX document (`figures_ml.tex`) and can be compiled using any LaTeX editor. Alternatively, view the compiled PDF to see the latest version of all figures.

## Compilation Instructions
1. Download the `.tex` file.
2. Open it in your LaTeX editor of choice (e.g., Overleaf, TexShop).
3. Compile the file to generate the PDF with all figures.
