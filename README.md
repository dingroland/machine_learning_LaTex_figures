# Machine Learning Figures

This repository contains a collection of figures created using LaTeX and TikZ to visually represent various machine learning concepts. These illustrations cover topics such as:

- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
- kD-Trees
- Regression and Classification
- Train-Test Split
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Confusion Matrices
- Hyperparameters
- Missing Data Handling

## PDF Progress

A compiled PDF (`figures_ml_progress.pdf`) is included to showcase the current progress of all figures in the repository. This file will be regularly updated as new figures are added.

## How to Use

The figures are embedded in a LaTeX document (`figures_ml.tex`) and can be compiled using any LaTeX editor. If you prefer to view the figures directly, you can check out the PDF file, which reflects the latest version of all the figures.

### Future Updates

I plan to continually update this repository with new machine learning figures as I progress in my studies and projects. Stay tuned for more!

### Compilation Instructions

1. Download the `.tex` file.
2. Open it in your LaTeX editor of choice (e.g., Overleaf or TexShop).
3. Compile the file to generate the PDF with the figures.
